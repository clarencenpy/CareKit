CareKit is a toolkit for authoring and deploying Chatbots to the Facebook Messenger platform, developed in collaboration with CMU University Health Services to increase student engagement on health issues. Our motivation comes from the fact that Chatbots present a “always-on”, scalable, and customisable way to have conversations with students on issues related to health and wellness, and could be a great supplement to the fantastic programs that UHS already runs on campus. Our team wanted to build something generic and open up content creation on Chatbots to non-technical users. The result?

* An intuitive GUI to design chat flows and “one-click” deploy to Facebook Messenger 
* Ability to save and share drafts of the chat flows and collaborate with colleagues before deploying it
* Support for sending rich message types that include images, weblinks, and even to call a phone number
